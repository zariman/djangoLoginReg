Assign the third author to the first 4 books
    Author.objects.get(id=3).books.add(Book.objects.get(id=1), Book.objects.get(id=2), Book.objects.get(id=3), Book.objects.get(id=4))

Assign the fourth author to the first 5 books (or in other words, all the books)
    Author.objects.get(id=4).books.add(*(Book.objects.filter(id__gt=0, id__lt=6)))
